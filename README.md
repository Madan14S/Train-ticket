🚆 Train Ticket Booking Prediction — Deep Neural Network (NumPy From Scratch)
This project builds a 5-layer deep neural network completely from scratch using NumPy, designed to predict whether a train ticket booking will be successful or not. The dataset involves several categorical and numerical fields, all of which are transformed manually before training the neural network.

The project demonstrates how deep learning works internally: ✔ Manual feature preprocessing ✔ Multi-layer forward propagation ✔ Multi-layer backpropagation ✔ Gradient descent optimization ✔ Training loss monitoring ✔ Manual binary classification inference

Everything is implemented without TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.

📊 Dataset Overview
Dataset used: `train_ticket_booking_dataset_50000.csv`

It contains 50,000+ rows with the following features:

Feature	Description
Day_of_Week	Day of booking
Time_of_Booking	Morning / Afternoon / Evening / Night
Train_Popularity	Low / Medium / High
Season	Normal / Holiday / Festival
Travel_Class	Sleeper / 3AC / 2AC / 1AC
Booking_Type	Tatkal / Normal
Booking_Status	Final output label (0 = Fail, 1 = Success)
🔄 Data Preprocessing (Manual Encoding)
All categorical values are mapped manually to integers:

Day_of_Week
Mon → 2 Tue → 3 Wed → 4 Thu → 5 Fri → 6 Sat → 7 Sun → 1

Time_of_Booking
Morning → 1 Afternoon → 2 Evening → 3 Night → 4

Train_Popularity
Low → 1 Medium → 2 High → 3

Season
Normal → 1 Holiday → 2 Festival → 3

Travel_Class
Sleeper → 1 3AC → 2 2AC → 3 1AC → 4

Booking_Type
Tatkal → 1 Normal → 2

Splitting the Dataset
First 50,000 rows → Training set
Remaining rows → Test set, saved as `Test_dataset.csv`
🧠 Neural Network Architecture
The network contains 5 hidden layers, implemented with plain NumPy:

Layer	Neurons	Activation
Input Layer	13 features	—
Hidden Layer 1	13 neurons	Sigmoid
Hidden Layer 2	10 neurons	Sigmoid
Hidden Layer 3	7 neurons	Sigmoid
Hidden Layer 4	3 neurons	Sigmoid
Output Layer	1 neuron	Sigmoid
The final output is binary:

`0` → Booking unsuccessful
`1` → Booking successful
🧮 Activation Functions
Sigmoid
[ \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} ]

Sigmoid Derivative
[ \sigma'(a) = a(1 - a) ]

🔢 Forward Propagation
Forward pass executes in this order: Input X ↓ Z1 = W1·X + b1 A1 = sigmoid(Z1) ↓ Z2 = W2·A1 + b2 A2 = sigmoid(Z2) ↓ Z3 = W3·A2 + b3 A3 = sigmoid(Z3) ↓ Z4 = W4·A3 + b4 A4 = sigmoid(Z4) ↓ Z5 = W5·A4 + b5 A5 = sigmoid(Z5) ← Final output

🔄 Backpropagation
Error is propagated back through all 5 layers using:

`dZ5`, `dW5`, `db5`
`dZ4`, `dW4`, `db4`
`dZ3`, `dW3`, `db3`
`dZ2`, `dW2`, `db2`
`dZ1`, `dW1`, `db1`
Gradient Descent Update:
[ W := W - \alpha \cdot dW ] [ b := b - \alpha \cdot db ]

Where α = learning rate.

⚙️ Training Configuration
Hyperparameter	Value
Epochs	10,000
Learning Rate	0.1
Batch Size	64
Loss function	Binary Cross-Entropy
Activation	Sigmoid (all layers)
Loss is recorded at each epoch and stored in `cost`.

📉 Loss Visualization
Loss curve is plotted using:

```python sns.lineplot(cost) ``` This shows whether the model is converging properly.

🧪 Prediction Pipeline
Once trained, each test sample is passed through all 5 layers. Binary classification rule:

If A5 >= 0.5 → Predict 1 Else → Predict 0

This is done for all rows in the test dataset to compute accuracy.

🎯 Final Accuracy
Accuracy is calculated using:

'_' allowed only in math mode

$$
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{correct_predictions}}{\text{total_test_samples}} \times 100
$$

You will see output like:

``` Accuracy : 87.24% ``` (Your accuracy may vary depending on initialization and randomness.)

📦 Requirements
Install required libraries:

``` pip install numpy pandas seaborn ```

▶️ How to Run
To execute the complete training pipeline:

Option 1 — Run as Python script ``` python train_model.py ```

Option 2 — Run Jupyter Notebook / VSCode Execute all cells in order.
